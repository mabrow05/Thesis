Physics travelled a long well-trodden road before arriving at theories which
describe the interactions between matter. For those who may be reading this thesis
either out of shear chance or simply to support me, we'll begin with a digression
on the history of particle physics beginning with the discovery of sub-microscopic
building blocks. Otherwise, hopefully the theories which describe the decay of the
neutron will be laid out in such a way that everyone can learn something.
