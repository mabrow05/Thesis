Designing an experiment and collecting the right data are non-trivial alone,
but calibrating the system and analyzing the data holds the meat and bones of
any trustworthy scientific result. The calibration is a beautiful combination
of simulation and data manipulation which allows one to extract the energy of
an event based solely on some electronic signal. Imagine a baseball pitcher
throwing a fastball into a sheet, and the observer behind the sheet must
determine the velocity of the ball from only seeing the impression the pitch
made on the sheet. This is the task every nuclear physics experiment is faced
with, only the baseball is a particle and the sheet is our detecotr system.
Below we focus on the energy calibration of our apparatus.
